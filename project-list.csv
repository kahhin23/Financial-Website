,AIA International Limited,welcome to know about wealth management,KEER HU,Senior wealth management manager,China (Hong Kong),"AIA (AIA Group Limited) in Hong Kong AIA in Hong Kong is a leading life insurance and financial services organization. AIA offers a wide range of insurance products such as life insurance, critical illness insurance, and retirement plans. These products provide financial protection for individuals and their families. For example, life insurance can ensure that in the event of the policyholder's death, the beneficiaries receive a sum of money to maintain their living standards and cover financial obligations like mortgages and educational expenses. In terms of wealth management, it plays a crucial role. Wealth Management Importance • Long - term Financial Security: Wealth management helps Hong Kong residents plan for their long - term financial goals. With the high cost of living and an aging population, it's essential to have a proper strategy to ensure a stable financial future. For instance, through investment - linked insurance plans, people can accumulate wealth over time to support their retirement life. • Asset Diversification: In a volatile global economic environment, AIA's wealth management services assist clients in diversifying their assets. Hong Kong is an international financial center, and investors have access to a variety of investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, and funds. By spreading investments across different asset classes, the risk of significant losses due to the poor performance of a single investment can be reduced. • Tax - efficient Planning: Wealth management also takes into account tax - efficient strategies. Hong Kong has its own tax regime, and through proper planning, clients can optimize their tax liabilities. For example, some insurance - based wealth management products offer tax - deferred benefits, allowing clients to grow their wealth more effectively. • Inheritance and Estate Planning: For families in Hong Kong, wealth management is vital for inheritance and estate planning. AIA can provide solutions to ensure a smooth transfer of assets to the next generation. This may include setting up trust - based insurance plans to protect family wealth and distribute it according to the client's wishes.",Financial Technology,Y,,,,,,,,,,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.affdeal-making.hk/marketplace/opportunities/UGFydGljaXBhdGlvbk9wcG9ydHVuaXR5OjE0MDIzMA==

,ApexCarbon Limited,ApexCarbon Limited,Ricky Lau,Director,,"The scope of ESG is covering a wide range of subjects. If we deep dive into the KPIs required by exchanges, most of the KPIs are related to environmental impact. Precisely, more than 50% KPIs are regarding energy use and wastes treatment. Emission comes from hydrocarbon energy. Company emissions cannot simply be wiped out by purchasing carbon credits for abatement. It is known that emissions stay in the atmosphere for 300-1000 years, whereas a tree can sequester CO2 for several decades. The only way to mitigate companies’ climate impacts is to reduce emissions by using clean energy. Clean energy can be sourced from hydrogen. Green hydrogen energy is best alternative for companies’ emission reduction. The beauty of it would be zero emission throughout production to consumption. However, there may be structural changes, despite of cost effectiveness, for the transition from hydrocarbon energy to hydrogen. It is important that some of the areas around the world (e.g. Hong Kong) cannot 100% shift from hydrocarbon to clean energy in a short period of time. For instance, to meet with 1.5oC target, carbon credits are the effective tools during the transition. Understanding carbon offsets has proven to be a difficult task if the companies are not an expert in the field. Carbon credits in voluntary market has been established for years and riddled with greenwashing, to make a difference, the company is encouraged to co-invest into nature-based solutions, including conservation of existing forest, reforestation, soil carbon, biochar and blue carbon. These types of nature-based carbon credits have been received global recognition and best fit for companies’ unavoidable emission with demonstrated true climate impact . This also allow projects to be financed by issuing carbon credits from quantifying carbon removals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.affdeal-making.hk/marketplace/opportunities/UGFydGljaXBhdGlvbk9wcG9ydHVuaXR5OjE0MDEyMQ==

,BlueMount Capital (Qld) Pty Ltd,Project Car Share,Flora Mok,"Director, M&A",New Zealand,"Project Car Share launched in December 2016 with just three vehicles and has since expanded to be an integral part of living for tens of thousands of members. Its expansion in February 2022 provided a template for rolling out into new cities and displays the scalability of the Company's model. The Company has ambitions to launch in 20 regional cities, with at least three cities targeted for 2025. By providing instant, convenient access to cars for individuals and businesses, Project Car Share replaces car ownership, car leases, car rentals and taxi trips. Importantly, it targets trips between one hour and one day, an area of the market underserved by the likes of Uber or traditional car rental companies. Third-party research suggests that every Project Car Share vehicle replaces 10+ private vehicles (via sold or foregone purchases by users). This supports a fundamental change to our cost of living, congestion, emissions, and how we use the space in the cities we call home. Investment Highlights ➢ New Zealand’s leading tech-driven car-sharing service, providing on-demand car access as an alternative to private ownership and corporate fleets; ➢ 50,000+ members, including hundreds of business and corporate clients; ➢ Grown revenue from c.NZ$1m FY20 to c.NZ$5.4m FY24 at a CAGR of 52%; ➢ A successful 2022 launch into the Auckland market highlighted the opportunity for further New Zealand growth; ➢ 3+ New Zealand cities targeted for launch in 2025; ➢ NZ$4.42 of funds have been committed to date.

,Cimple Biotechnology Limited,Quantitative Rapid Test for At-home Screening and Management of Personal Healthcare  |  用于居家监测和个人健康管理的定量快速检测仪,Wengang LIU,CEO,China (Hong Kong),"We are developing a quantitative rapid test for at-home self-screening and management of personal healthcare. This quantitative rapid test includes a microfluidic device and a mobile app. Urine or blood specimen is sampled by dipping, with a fixed volume through a capillary valve. Next, the sample will resuspend the dried magnetic microparticles (MMPs) and polystyrene microparticles (PMPs) in the reaction chamber. MMPs and PMPs will be surface coated with binding agents so the presence of target biomarker would alter the connections between MMPs and PMPs. After reaction, the particle solution will be directed to a magnetic separator that removes the MMPs and the connected PMPs, leaving free PMPs to keep on flowing until they are trapped at a particle dam. Thus, the level of biomarker would alter the PMP accumulation length, which is quantifiable by a mobile app. The project is supported by the HK Tech300 Angel Fund from City University of Hong Kong and Incu-Bio Programme of Hong Kong Science & Technology Parks Corporation. Additionally, the project has received investment intentions amounting to tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars from several venture capital firms, as well as support from multiple companies in the industry. It has been nominated by City University of Hong Kong to participate in the latest RAISE+ program. We look forward to having more partners to accelerate the commercialization process of the project. 我们正在开发一款用于居家自我监测和个人健康管理的定量快速检测工具。这款定量快速检测工具包含一个微流控设备和一款移动应用程序。检测时，通过毛细管阀采集固定体积的尿液或血液样本。接下来，样本会重新悬浮在反应腔内的干燥磁性微粒子（MMPs）和聚苯乙烯微粒（PMPs）中。MMPs 和 PMPs 的表面涂有结合剂，所以目标生物标志物的存在会改变 MMPs 和 PMPs 之间的连接关系。反应完成后，颗粒溶液会被引导至磁分离器，磁性分离器会移除 MMPs 和已连接的 PMPs，留下来的自由PMPs，令其继续流动直至被阻挡颗粒的阻挡槽捕获。因此，生物标志物的水平会改变 PMP 的累积长度，这一过程可通过移动应用程序进行量化。 该项目获得了香港城市大学 HK Tech300 天使基金和香港科学园公司生物医药科技培育计划（Incu-Bio Programme）的支持。此外，该项目还获得了多家风险投资公司数千万港元的投资意向，以及多家行业公司的支持。项目已被香港城市大学提名参与最新的 RAISE+ 计划。我们期待与更多合作伙伴携手，共同加速项目的商业化进程。 ",Healthcare Technology,,,,Y,,,,,,,"25,000,001 to 50,000,000 USD",,,,,,,,Y,,Seed & Pre-Series A,Y,,,,,Minority Stake,Common Shares,https://www.affdeal-making.hk/marketplace/opportunities/UGFydGljaXBhdGlvbk9wcG9ydHVuaXR5OjEzOTUzOQ==

,Hylid Diagnostics Inc.,Home blood-potassium monitoring,Jack Fairbank,CEO,Canada,"High blood potassium (hyperkalemia) is a common result of many chronic diseases and medications for them—eg chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), hypertension—and causes heart attacks and huge treatment costs. Medicare alone spends $41B/year on hyperkalemia. However, patients can't measure and control their potassium to control costs. Hylid Diagnostics will put a cost-effective and lab-accurate meter in the hands of patients, allowing them to get frequent feedback on their potassium levels from a fingerprick drop of blood. Measurements will also be sent to physicians, who can oversee care remotely, with AI assistance.

,"Wuxi Yinhzhui Technology Development Co., Ltd.",A Biobased temperature-sensitive material commercialization,Zeyun Zhu,CEO,China (Hong Kong),"This is a bio - based temperature - sensitive material. It has a rather special property: at room temperature, it behaves like a plastic, being rigid and stable. However, when exposed to heat above sixty Celsius, it transforms into a rubber - like state, becoming flexible and pliable. This unique characteristic makes it extremely beneficial for use in individualized customization. These materials are the outcome of extensive industry - university - research collaborations, which are focused on creating consumer products that meet specific requirements. One of the key advantages of these materials is their suitability for mass manufacturing through our advanced technology. This enables us to provide customers with products that can be tailored to their individual needs. As a temperature - sensitive material, it has the remarkable ability to be reshaped and reused as the customers' requirements change over time, which not only offers great flexibility but also promotes sustainability by reducing waste. Our focus is on our business model which is to provide downstream enterprises with front - end technical support services as well as back - end overseas market - oriented expansion, branding, and overseas market development. We have used this material to create sports protection gears for Paralympic athletes in global competitions. These gears can adapt to different environmental and body conditions, providing optimal protection and performance. We have also been involved in helping disabled people by using this material in prosthetic sockets. The temperature - sensitive nature of the material allows for a more comfortable and better - fitting socket, which is crucial for the well - being and mobility of the disabled. Additionally, this material has been applied in medical rehabilitation and orthopedic fixation. In medical rehabilitation, it can assist in the recovery process by providing appropriate support and flexibility as the patient heals. In orthopedic fixation, it can offer a more adaptable and comfortable solution compared to traditional materials. Overall, these bio - based temperature - sensitive materials represent a significant advancement in the development of sustainable and adaptable materials for a variety of industries, and we are enthusiastic about exploring more applications and partnerships globally. 这是一种基于生物的温度敏感材料。它具有相当特殊的特性：在室温下，它表现得像塑料，坚硬而稳定。然而，当暴露于超过六十摄氏度的热量时，它会变成橡胶状，变得柔韧。这种独特的特性使其在个性化定制中使用起来极为有益。 这些材料是广泛的产业与大学合作研究的成果，这些合作专注于创造各种能够满足特定要求的消费品。这些材料的主要优势之一是它们适合通过我们的先进技术进行大规模制造。这使我们能够为客户提供可以根据他们的个人需求量身定制的产品。作为一种对温度敏感的材料，随着客户需求的不断变化，它具有非凡的重塑和再利用能力，这不仅提供了很大的灵活性，而且还通过减少废弃物来促进可持续性。 我们的重点是我们的业务模式，即为下游企业提供前端技术支持服务以及后端海外市场导向的扩张、品牌推广和海外市场拓展。 我们利用此材料为参与全球比赛的残奥会运动员打造运动防护装备。这些装备可以适应不同的环境和身体状况，提供最佳的保护和性能。我们还通过在假肢接受腔中使用这种材料来帮助残疾人。这种材料的温度敏感性质能够实现更舒适和更好的装配接受腔，这对残疾人的辛福感和移动性至关重要。此外，该材料已应用于医疗康复和骨科固定。在医学康复中，它可以通过在患者愈合过程中提供适当的支撑和灵活性来帮助康复。在骨科固定中，与传统材料相比，它可以提供适应性更强、更舒适的解决方案。 总体而言，这些基于生物的温度敏感材料代表着在为各行各业开发可持续且适应性强的材料方面取得的重大进步。我们热衷于探索更多的应用和在全球寻求更多的合作伙伴关系。 ","Consumer,Healthcare Technology,Environment, Energy and Clean Technology",,,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,"7,500,001 to 10,000,000 USD",,,,,,Y,,,,Seed & Pre-Series A,Y,,,,,JV / Partnership,"Common Shares,Preferred Shares",https://www.affdeal-making.hk/marketplace/opportunities/UGFydGljaXBhdGlvbk9wcG9ydHVuaXR5OjEzODcxMA==

,武汉大通黎峰股权投资有限公司,Happy World Children's Park 欢乐世界儿童乐园,峰 何,董事总经理,China (Hong Kong),"Executive Summary I. Project Overview Squirrel Wonderland is an innovative theme park project combining mechanical rides, pet interaction, camping experiences, family fishing, fitness zones, and more. It aims to provide an integrated experience of sports, entertainment, and education for children of all ages and their families while offering memorable interactive and exploratory experiences for all-age visitors. The project plans to rapidly expand market share through mergers and acquisitions of profitable park resources, leveraging industry expertise and standardized operational models to establish a strong brand presence. Secondary consumption (e.g., DIY crafts, food services, and themed activities) will further enhance profitability, ensuring steady revenue growth and driving industry upgrades. According to a report by Research Insights, the Chinese amusement park market reached a total scale of 90 billion RMB in 2023 and is expected to grow to 120 billion RMB by 2025, with an annual growth rate of approximately 14%. Among emerging segments, non-powered parks stood out, with a market size of 10 billion RMB in 2023, projected to exceed 30 billion RMB by 2025, reflecting an annual growth rate of 45%. By offering differentiated positioning and diverse activities, Squirrel Wonderland fills a market gap while setting new industry directions with its customer-focused experiences. Target Market Family Interaction Demand ● In 2022, Chinese families spent 300 billion RMB on children's entertainment and education, with over 20% allocated to amusement parks. This trend underscores the growing demand for family entertainment as families increasingly value shared activities to strengthen relationships. Health and Education Focus ● Modern parents prioritize their children’s physical and mental development, favoring venues that combine exercise, learning, and fun. Non-powered parks address this need with edutainment activities that foster physical and intellectual growth. Filling Market Gaps ● China’s amusement park market is primarily dominated by traditional mechanical parks, lacking natural interaction and family-oriented facilities. Squirrel Wonderland bridges this gap, appealing to families seeking fresh, high-quality experiences. Investment Highlights ● Agreements for acquiring 20 parks are nearing completion, showcasing strong resource integration capabilities. ● ● Vast market potential with differentiated positioning. ● ● Planned IPO within two years, offering investors an exit channel. Financing Plan Financing Objective ● Seeking first-round financing of 50 million RMB in exchange for 15% equity. Allocation of Funds ● Acquisition of 20 Parks ○ Majority of funds will be used to complete acquisition negotiations with target parks, ensuring resource integration and expansion to rapidly increase market share. ● Standardization and Operational Optimization ○ A portion of funds will be allocated to developing and implementing standardized operational processes to improve management efficiency and ensure consistency and high-quality service across all parks. ● Brand Awareness Development ○ Investments will be made in branding, marketing, and promotional activities to boost brand recognition and attract more families and children to the parks. ● Facility and Experience Upgrades ○ Funds will be utilized to enhance park facilities, adding interactive and educational elements to ensure a rich and engaging experience for the target market. Profit Forecast ● Initial Revenue: Estimated annual revenue of 40 million RMB in the early stages. ● Mature Revenue: Annual revenue projected to reach 540 million RMB, with a net profit margin of 70%. ● Investment Payback Period: Estimated at 6.65 years, with stable and reliable",Consumer,,,,,Y,,,,,,"500,001 to 1,000,000 USD",,Y,,,,,,,,Series A,,Y,,,,Minority Stake,Common Shares,https://www.affdeal-making.hk/marketplace/opportunities/UGFydGljaXBhdGlvbk9wcG9ydHVuaXR5OjEzNjIzNg==
