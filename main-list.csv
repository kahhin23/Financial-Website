2019年《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》出台的那一年，一批港澳青年和在香港就讀的內地青年創立了粵港澳大灣區青年創新創業中心，並將中心落戶深圳前海。港澳青年非常看重內地市場，粵港澳大灣區青年創新創業中心是由香港青年創新創業協會發起成立運營。2021年，粵港澳大灣區青年創新創業中心已入駐了56家港澳創業團隊。
協會發展到2021年共有包含粵港澳高校科研人員、香港區議員、投資人、港澳青年創業者、在校大學生132位理事會成員；秘書處、宣傳部、外聯部、創業實踐部、投資融資部、政策研究部、技術轉移部、高校聯絡處8個職能部門；北京、澳門、上海、廣州、深圳、武漢、成都、佛山等8個代表處，協會會員超過1000人。與地方政府、大學、產業園區合作運營7個港澳青年創新創業基地，承辦國家雙創周香港分會場、參與中央香港局勢座談會、香港在深學習就業創業青年座談會、深圳口岸改革創新研討會等政府會議30餘次。舉辦「京津翼—粵港澳（國際）青年創新創業大賽」等創業創業活動100餘場。

The Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association was established in 2017. With the care and support of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of Guangdong Province, the Home Affairs Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and other departments, the Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association has developed rapidly and has become a vital force in serving the innovation and entrepreneurship of Hong Kong and Macao youth.
In 2019, the year when the ""Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" was released, a group of Hong Kong and Macao youth and mainland youth studying in Hong Kong founded the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, which was located in Qianhai, Shenzhen. Hong Kong and Macao youth attach great importance to the mainland market. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center was initiated, established and operated by the Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association. In 2021, 56 Hong Kong and Macao entrepreneurial teams had settled in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center.
By 2021, the Association had 132 members of the board of directors, including scientific research personnel from universities in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, Hong Kong district councilors, investors, Hong Kong and Macao young entrepreneurs, and undergraduate students. It also had eight functional departments: the Secretariat, the Publicity Department, the Liaison Department, the Entrepreneurship Practice Department, the Investment and Financing Department, the Policy Research Department, the Technology Transfer Department, and the University Liaison Office. There were eight representative offices in Beijing, Macao, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Foshan. The number of members of the Association exceeded 1,000. The Association jointly operated seven innovation and entrepreneurship bases for Hong Kong and Macao youth in cooperation with local governments, universities, and industrial parks. It hosted the Hong Kong sub-venue of the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week, participated in more than 30 government meetings such as the Central Symposium on the Hong Kong Situation, the Symposium on Hong Kong Youth Studying, Working and Starting Businesses in Shenzhen, and the Shenzhen Port Reform and Innovation Seminar. It also organized more than 100 entrepreneurship activities such as the ""Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei - Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao (International) Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition""."

If we deep dive into the KPIs required by exchanges, most of the KPIs are related to environmental impact. Precisely, more than 50% KPIs are regarding energy use and wastes treatment. Emission comes from hydrocarbon energy. Company emissions cannot simply be wiped out by purchasing carbon credits for abatement. It is known that emissions stay in the atmosphere for 300-1000 years, whereas a tree can sequester CO2 for several decades. The only way to mitigate companies’ climate impacts is to reduce emissions by using clean energy.

Clean energy can be sourced from hydrogen. Green hydrogen energy is best alternative for companies’ emission reduction. The beauty of it would be zero emission throughout production to consumption. However, there may be structural changes, despite of cost effectiveness, for the transition from hydrocarbon energy to hydrogen. It is important that some of the areas around the world (e.g. Hong Kong) cannot 100% shift from hydrocarbon to clean energy in a short period of time. For instance, to meet with 1.5oC target, carbon credits are the effective tools during the transition.

Understanding carbon offsets has proven to be a difficult task if the companies are not an expert in the field. Carbon credits in voluntary market has been established for years and riddled with greenwashing, to make a difference, the company is encouraged to co-invest into nature-based solutions, including conservation of existing forest, reforestation, soil carbon, biochar and blue carbon.

The organisational form of an independent non-profit organisation was chosen to allow the organisation to be truly independent. Its objective is non-profit driven and guided by the belief that future human development can only be sustainable if GHG emissions are significantly reduced. Government regulation without financial, market-driven incentives is unlikely to be very effective in reducing sufficient GHG emissions to meet the Paris Agreement goals. For a successful market to develop, a framework with fully transparent standards is needed. These standards help to accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral economy by creating creditable, transparent, and high-quality carbon credits."

With the improvement of people's quality of life, more and more people start to learn music; Erhu, as a traditional Chinese instrument, has drawn a lot of attention. However, we observe that the related devices of Erhu are relatively low-end with only a single function (such as a case), which are neither portable nor easy to use (such as the music stand and amplification equipment); and many learners give up halfway and become frustrated due to the difficulty in mastering the intonation and skills during practice. This product and service are introduced to address this issue: which include hardware (multi-function case) + Erhu intelligent learning assistant software (AI intonation controller) + APP-based platform resource project. The hardware, namely the multi-function case, is designed to provide a portable, practical and versatile device to carry. The software uses advanced technology to design a product that is visually intuitive as well as emotionally encouraging for learning the instrument. It will transform the intangible part into a tangible one and lead to precise pitch tuning, so that beginners can quickly have a perception and accuracy about the tone and become confident and persistent in learning. In the short term, first we plan to develop multi-function case for Erhu and audio controller developed using AI sound recognition technology (patent application has been submitted for both) ; second, we will use this technology to expand to other string instruments without timbre, such as Gaohu, Banhu and Zhonghu, continuing to benefit music lovers with iterative products. Third, we will establish interactive community platforms using AI + practice + sharing, and reshape new forms of practice and education, so as to make more people enjoy music and bring people a healthy and active living environment through community activities.

本公司是初创企业，拟定业务范围包括数码产品、软件开发、技术服务，乐器及接口设备开发与销售，国际贸易等。随着人们生活质量的提高，越来越多的人加入学习音乐行列，二胡作为中国传统乐器，受到了广泛的关注。但我们发现，二胡的外围设备比较低端，功能单一（如琴箱），携带、使用诸多不便（如谱架和扩音设备）；且许多学习者在练习过程中难以掌握音准和技巧，因而半途而废、惋而息琴。为解决这一问题，推出本产品与服务：包括硬件（多功能琴箱）+二胡智能学习助手软件（AI音准控制器）+APP平台资源项目。硬件即多功能琴箱，旨在提供一种轻便实用、多功能的携带设备；软件部分即采用先进科技手段将传统的无品乐器，设计一种能在视觉上直观和感性上促进学琴的产品，将无形变有形，将无品变精准定音，使初学者快速掌握音感音准，坚定学习的信心和恒心。短期发展步骤，首先拟开发二胡多功能琴箱，以及运用AI声音识别技术开发的音品控制器（以上两项已提交申请专利）两个产品；其次运用该技术，以二胡为切入点扩展到其他无音品的弦乐器，如高胡、板胡、中胡等，将迭代产品不断受惠爱乐群体；再次，建立互动小区平台，AI+练习+分享，重塑新型练习和教育方式，物、互交融，让更多人喜爱音乐，通过小区活动给人们带来健康活跃的生活环境。"

        在环境权益交易方面，绿交所是深圳地区碳排放交易的唯一法定平台，以深圳获批国家首批低碳试点城市和碳交易试点省市为契机，启动全国乃至发展中国家首个碳交易市场，参编全国首部碳排放地方法规《深圳经济特区碳排放管理若干规定》。2014年，绿交所获国家外汇管理局批复可为境外投资者办理跨境碳排放权交易业务，深圳碳市场成为国家外汇管理局批准的首个允许境外投资者参与的碳市场。2016年，成为国家发改委授权的首个全国碳市场能力建设中心。运行十余载，深圳碳市场成交额在国内各试点碳市场中率先突破亿元，流动率多年全国第一。
        目前，深圳碳市场共有重点排放单位737家，覆盖工业、交通、服务业等39个行业，累计交易量超1亿吨，交易额突破23亿元，境外投资机构参与交易额达2.47亿元。深圳碳市场以3%的配额规模占比，创造了全国试点碳市场12.63%的交易额和11.22%的交易量，年均流动率多年居全国第一。深圳碳市场机制带动城市减排成效显著，助力重点排放单位工业增加值实现62.65%增长的同时，碳排放强度下降42.07%，已形成碳排放与工业增长“双向脱钩”的健康发展态势。在碳市场的助推下，深圳能耗强度、碳排放强度和用水强度分别降低至全国平均水平的1/3、1/5和1/8，全国最低、世界先进。
        在碳普惠体系建设方面，绿交所发布了全国首个居民低碳用电碳普惠方法学，并推动国内首个居民低碳用电“碳普惠”应用在深圳上线；创新碳普惠消纳场景，2023年上线深骑行和深出行两个项目，并逐步打通碳市场履约、碳中和抵消、生态环境损害赔偿、乡村振兴生态帮扶等5种消纳场景。2023年深圳碳普惠核证减排量交易量4.6万吨。
        在绿色金融服务方面，自2017年起，绿交所成为深圳市绿色金融工作重要支撑单位，紧紧围绕“三大功能”“五大支柱”总体布局开展工作。绿交所身兼深圳经济特区金融学会绿色金融专业委员会秘书处单位、全国金融标准化技术委员会绿色金融标准工作组成员单位、粤港澳大湾区绿色金融联盟副秘书长单位、深圳气候投融资促进中心等多重身份，参编并协助主管部门推动我国首部绿色金融法规《深圳经济特区绿色金融条例》出台，首创六项碳金融创新服务，审定办理“绿票通”业务1525笔，累计金额47.76亿元，赋能产业绿色发展。此外，绿交所协助福田区开展国家气候投融资试点，现入库绿色项目共计196个，对应融资需求达411亿元，预计项目实施后将每年减少约600万吨二氧化碳排放。
        2024年8月，绿交所以更名为“深圳绿色交易所”为契机，继续以绿色交易、咨询和金融“三驾齐驱”的方式服务于深圳的绿色发展。秉持“可持续发展先锋”的使命，绿交所围绕“一核两翼双擎”的总体布局，从“六个协同”出发，规划深圳碳市场的转型升级。通过碳交易与碳普惠协同、区域协同、金融协同、减污降碳协同、电碳协同及绿色供应链协同，探索碳交易与其他生态权益交易的协同发展路径，打造综合性的生态权益交易平台，助力深圳实现绿色高质量发展，服务国家碳达峰碳中和目标，支持乡村振兴战略，贡献深交易人的智慧与力量。"
